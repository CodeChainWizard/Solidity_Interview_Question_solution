// In the context of solidity and amart contract development, the SafeMath library includes a function named multiple designed for secure multiplication
// Of unsigned integers(uint256). Explain the purpose and significance of using the multiple function in SafeMath, What risks does it address, particularly
// Realted to arithmetic overflow, and how does it contributes to the overall security of smart contracts? Provide an example scenario where the absences of SafrMath in multiplication operations could lead to vulnerabilities, and elaborated on how the mul function helps mitigate such ricks.

// â€”> IMPORTANT POINT
